# Advanced

In this section, we will go into advanced topics that extend beyond basic usage. Given Burn's
exceptional flexibility, a lot of advanced use cases become possible.

Before going through this section, we strongly recommend exploring the
[basic workflow](../basic-workflow/) section and the
[building blocks](../building-blocks/) section. Establishing a solid understanding of how
the framework operates is crucial to comprehending the advanced concepts presented here. While you
have the freedom to explore the advanced sections in any order you prefer, it's important to note
that this section is not intended to be linear, contrary to preceding sections. Instead, it serves
as a repository of use cases that you can refer to for guidance as needed.
