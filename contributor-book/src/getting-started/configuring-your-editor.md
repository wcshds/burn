# Configuring your editor

These steps are not required, and most of this isn't specific to Burn, but it's definitely helpful
if you haven't already done it.

## VSCode

Install the following extensions:

- [rust-lang.rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
  for Rust syntax and semantic analysis
- [tamasfe.even-better-toml](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)
  for TOML syntax and semantic analysic
- [serayuzgur.crates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=serayuzgur.crates) for
  managing dependencies
- [vadimcn.vscode-lldb](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) for
  debugging

### Setting up the Debugger

To use the debugger, follow these steps:

1. Open `Command Palette` with `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `F1` and type
   `LLDB: Generate Launch Configurations from Cargo.toml` then select it, this will generate a file
   that should be saved as `.vscode/launch.json`.
2. Select the configuration from the "run and debug" side panel, then select the target from the
   list.
3. Now you can enable breakpoints on code through IDE then start debugging the library/binary you
   want, like in the following example:

![debug-options](debug-options-vscode.png)

If you're creating a new library or binary, keep in mind to repeat step 1 to always keep a fresh
list of targets.
