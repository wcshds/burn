# Importing Models

The Burn project supports the import of models from various frameworks, emphasizing efficiency and
compatibility. Currently, it handles two primary model formats:

1. [ONNX](https://burn.dev/book/import/onnx-model.html): Facilitates direct import, ensuring the
   model's performance and structure are maintained.

2. [PyTorch](https://burn.dev/book/import/pytorch-model.html): Enables the loading of PyTorch model
   weights into Burnâ€™s native model architecture, ensuring seamless integration.
